# HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various HackerRank problems.

## Directory Structure

- `problems/`: Contains `Algorithms/` and `Data_Structures/`directories, containing the respective HackerRank problems.
  - Each problem directory contains:
    - A Python file with the solution.
    - A _possible_ `test/` directory with test input files. _Some test cases are directly in the problem's main function_.
- `utils/`: Contains helper functions and utilities used across multiple solutions.

## How to Run

To run a specific problem solution:

1. Navigate to the problem directory.
2. Run the Python file directly.

Example:

```bash
cd problems/Data_Structures/HR-003-DynamicArray
python HR-003-DynamicArray.py
```
